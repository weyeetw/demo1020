## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(readxl)
setwd("/Users/wey/data/0928_class")
getwd() # get your current working directory

fish <- read.table('/Users/wey/data/0928_class/reef_fish.txt', header=T, sep='\t', dec='.') # store my table in an object called `fish`
fish

barplot(fish$richness, main="Top 10 reef fish Richness (Allen, 2000)", horiz=TRUE, names.arg=fish$country, cex.names=1, las=1)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
